# Instaformator
Python Scripts which generate white edges on images so they fit the instagram ratios (1:1, 4:5 or 4:3).
You can use Python 2 or Python 3

## Usage
- Put the script in a folder filled with images
- Go to your console and write `python3 instaformator.py` (or `python instaformator.py` if you only have one python installation)
- The generated pictures should be in a new folder named *Edged*

## Installation
You need to install *Pillow* to use this script :
```python3
pip3 install Pillow
```
